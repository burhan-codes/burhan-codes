# Steps to run the code
- There are two files of code: cambodia_helper.py and cambodia_main.ipynb
- **In cambodia_main.ipynb file, set the databse connection in the constructor of CambodiaMain class**
- **After setting database credentials, run all the cells of Jupyter Notebook**
- When the run is complete, accuracy result against five parameters will be printed.

**P.S:** It takes some time to connect with database and fetch all data. Then it takes time for processing all the text and printing results.
